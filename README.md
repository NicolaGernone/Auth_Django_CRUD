# Auth_Django_CRUD
CRUD to user authentication

The Candidate should build a CRUD application in a Python web framework, that allows a user to login using the Oauth protocol, with github as the provider.

Once logged in, they must be able to create/edit/delete/update their personal 

profile, e.g, name, past and actual address, phone number etc.

- Please make sure the repository for the project is publicly hosted on github

- Please make it easy to build, test and run your application

The project review will focus on the following points:

    - Clarity and intent within both production code, and test suites

    - Predictability of system behaviour

    - The amount of code written (less is more)

    - Coding standards

    - Ease of setup/running
